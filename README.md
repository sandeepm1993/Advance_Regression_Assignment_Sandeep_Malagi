## Assignment Overview

### Part-I:
- **Objective**: Predict the house prices in Australia.
- **Approach**: Use ridge and lasso regression for building the predictive model. Determine the optimal value of lambda for both techniques.

### Part-II:
- Four subjective questions that dive deep into the concepts of:
    1. Model coefficients and their significance with changing alpha values.
    2. Choosing between ridge and lasso based on the scenario.
    3. Importance of predictor variables and handling data where key predictors are missing.
    4. Ensuring model robustness and the implications of a robust model on accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset contains details of house sales in Australia. The target variable is the price of the house, and the independent variables describe various aspects related to the house and its surroundings.

## Results

After analysis and modeling, we identified the significant variables that impact house prices. Further, the optimal values of lambda for ridge and lasso regression were determined.
